Impact on Pregnancy of Gross and Microscopic Vasal Fluid during Vasectomy Reversal.
[StringElement('We compared fertility outcomes with gross and microscopic fluid findings at vasectomy reversal at a high volume vasectomy reversal center.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), StringElement('A retrospective study of a prospective database was performed. All vasectomy reversals were performed by a single surgeon (EFF) between 1978 and 2011. The clinical pregnancy rate was self-reported or determined via patient mailers. Patient and operative findings were determined through database review. We classified vasal fluid as opalescent, creamy, pasty or clear. Intraoperative light microscopy was used to determine if sperm or sperm parts were present and if they were motile. Multivariate analysis was performed evaluating patient age, partner age, years after vasectomy, type of surgery, and gross and microscopic fluid analysis.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'METHODS', u'Label': u'MATERIALS AND METHODS'}), StringElement('A total of 2,947 microsurgical vasectomy reversals were reviewed after we excluded reversals performed for post-vasectomy pain. We determined the pregnancy status of 902 (31%) cases. On univariate analysis with respect to pregnancy the presence of motile sperm at vasovasostomy neared statistical significance (p=0.075) and there was no difference between bilateral vs unilateral motile sperm. Gross fluid appearance was not statistically significant but we found the order of pregnancy success to be opalescent, creamy, clear then pasty fluid. On multivariate analysis only female partner age and sperm heads only or no sperm seen on light microscopy had statistical significance (p <0.05).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'RESULTS', u'Label': u'RESULTS'}), StringElement('The presence of motile sperm at vasectomy reversal approaches statistical significance on univariate analysis as a factor that affects clinical pregnancy rates. On multivariate analysis female partner age and microscopic findings of sperm heads only or no sperm are inversely related to pregnancy rates.

Pregnancy induces persistent changes in vascular compliance in primiparous women.
[StringElement('Pregnancy induces rapid, progressive, and substantial changes to the cardiovascular system.

Effect of asymptomatic vaginal colonization with Candida albicans on pregnancy outcome.
[StringElement('Vaginal infection is a major causative factor of preterm delivery. The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of asymptomatic vaginal colonization with Candida albicans at early gestation on pregnancy outcome.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'INTRODUCTION'}), StringElement('From 2005 to 2014, a total of 8447 women with singleton pregnancies between 10(+0) and 16(+0) gestational weeks were routinely subjected to an antenatal infection screen-and-treat program.

Treatment was repeated in case of recurrence. Women with normal or intermediate vaginal flora were considered as non-exposed. Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis were assessed and treated as well.
